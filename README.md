# AIWorld
Playground for AI logic in a sandbox like world.

Currently there is not much implemented, just a small world with five moving and five spinning "things".   

The goal of the project is to allow deploying things to the world which then can interact with other things in the world.  
Each thing has a position and a direction into which it "looks" currently. 
Things can move and turn around.
